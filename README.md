  - View aggregated cost summaries (group by project, service, or region)
  - Analyze cost trends over time (for charts and forecasting)

- **Budgets (Optional Extension)**

  - Set budgets per project
  - Track budget usage vs. actual spending
  - Trigger alerts when spending exceeds the budget

- **Reports**

  - Generate monthly and weekly reports
  - Export reports in JSON or CSV format
